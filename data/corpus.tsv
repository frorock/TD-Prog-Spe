My favorite climate change fact. I feel like this is hidden knowledge. It is an exception rather than the rule that the earth has ice at the poles during the summer. Here’s a graph showing that, from NOAA no less. For all of human “history” we have been used to abnormally cold temperatures. This data comes from using mass spectrometry to analyze tiny trapped bubbles of ancient atmosphere found in ice cores. No this doesn’t mean climate change is fake, yes it means those idiots saying it will be doomsday are factually incorrect. As usual with over politicized subjects, the truth requires nuance and pleases neither extreme.	1035

Climatologists? Meteorologists? And if 8% of scientists disagree I would like to hear their evidence for going against the grain and hearing why they don’t agree Also the main people I’ve heard that speak out about climate change have no background in climate science whatsoever, and are complete hypocrites in their personal lives Bill gates for example will fly around the world in his private jet burning more Co2 than I do in a year, yet he has the audacity to scold me for eating meat, having children or driving my car to work, and how does being the owner of Microsoft make you qualified to speak on climate change? Yet this guy made a whole documentary about it And finally when you compare real world natural disasters and the way society and governments react, they don’t act the same when it comes to climate change Back in the 80s it wasn’t climate change that was going to kill us in 20 years it was chlorofluorocarbons and the depletion of the ozone layer, as a result the entire world basically got together and agreed to stop the production of the chemicals and gasses that were killing the ozone layer But when it comes to climate change, explain to me how an individual can still obtain construction permits, insurance and loans when they want to build a new condominium on Miami Beach, or a new office building in New York City, if all these places are gonna be underwater in the next 30+ years Maybe it’s just because I grew up in arkansas and anyone who’s ever lived here knows the weather is bipolar but I’ve never experienced a difference in temperature in my life, and from the people I’ve asked tell me the same thing	73

18	arxiv	Precipitation extremes under climate change	Paul A. O'Gorman	2015-03-25T21:11:05Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07557v1	Precipitation extremes under climate change The response of precipitation extremes to climate change is considered using results from theory, modeling, and observations, with a focus on the physical factors that control the response. Observations and simulations with climate models show that precipitation extremes intensify in response to a warming climate. However, the sensitivity of precipitation extremes to warming remains uncertain when convection is important, and it may be higher in the tropics than the extratropics. Several physical contributions govern the response of precipitation extremes. The thermodynamic contribution is robust and well understood, but theoretical understanding of the microphysical and dynamical contributions is still being developed. Orographic precipitation extremes and snowfall extremes respond differently from other precipitation extremes and require particular attention. Outstanding research challenges include the influence of mesoscale convective organization, the dependence on the duration considered, and the need to better constrain the sensitivity of tropical precipitation extremes to warming.	0	
19	arxiv	Future Climate Change Projections over the Indian Region	J. Sanjay	2020-12-02T07:46:57Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.10386v1	Future Climate Change Projections over the Indian Region Assessments of impacts of climate change and future projections over the Indian region, have so far relied on a single regional climate model (RCM) - eg., the PRECIS RCM of the Hadley Centre, UK. While these assessments have provided inputs to various reports (e.g., INCCA 2010; NATCOMM2 2012), it is important to have an ensemble of climate projections drawn from multiple RCMs due to large uncertainties in regional-scale climate projections. Ensembles of multi-RCM projections driven under different perceivable socio-economic scenarios are required to capture the probable path of growth, and provide the behavior of future climate and impacts on various biophysical systems and economic sectors dependent on such systems. The Centre for Climate Change Research, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (CCCR-IITM) has generated an ensemble of high resolution downscaled projections of regional climate and monsoon over South Asia until 2100 for the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC)using a RCM (ICTP-RegCM4) at 50 km horizontal resolution, by driving the regional model with lateral and lower boundary conditions from multiple global atmosphere-ocean coupled models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). The future projections are based on three Representation Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (viz., RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP8.5) of the IPCC.	0	R. Krishnan;M. V. S. Ramarao;R.

20	arxiv	Invasive species, extreme fire risk, and toxin release under a changing climate	Kimberley Miner	2020-08-03T17:22:18Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01035v1	Invasive species, extreme fire risk, and toxin release under a changing climate Mediterranean ecosystems such as those found in California, Central Chile, Southern Europe, and Southwest Australia host numerous, diverse, fire-adapted micro-ecosystems. These micro-ecosystems are as diverse as mountainous conifer to desert-like chaparral communities. Over the last few centuries, human intervention, invasive species, and climate warming have drastically affected the composition and health of Mediterranean ecosystems on almost every continent. Increased fuel load from fire suppression policies and the continued range expansion of non-native insects and plants, some driven by long-term drought, produced the deadliest wildfire season on record in 2018. As a consequence of these fires, a large number of structures are destroyed, releasing household chemicals into the environment as uncontrolled toxins. The mobilization of these materials can lead to health risks and disruption in both human and natural systems. This article identifies drivers that led to a structural weakening of the mosaic of fire-adapted ecosystems in California, and subsequently increased the risk of destructive and explosive wildfires throughout the state. Under a new climate regime, managing the impacts on systems moving out-of-phase with natural processes may protect lives and ensure the stability of ecosystem services.	0	Laura Meyerson;.

21	arxiv	Climate Adaptation with Reinforcement Learning: Experiments with Flooding and Transportation in Copenhagen	Miguel Costa	2024-09-27T09:18:57Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18574v2	Climate Adaptation with Reinforcement Learning: Experiments with Flooding and Transportation in Copenhagen Due to climate change the frequency and intensity of extreme rainfall events, which contribute to urban flooding, are expected to increase in many places. These floods can damage transport infrastructure and disrupt mobility, highlighting the need for cities to adapt to escalating risks. Reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a powerful tool for uncovering optimal adaptation strategies, determining how and where to deploy adaptation measures effectively, even under significant uncertainty. In this study, we leverage RL to identify the most effective timing and locations for implementing measures, aiming to reduce both direct and indirect impacts of flooding. Our framework integrates climate change projections of future rainfall events and floods, models city-wide motorized trips, and quantifies direct and indirect impacts on infrastructure and mobility. Preliminary results suggest that our RL-based approach can significantly enhance decision-making by prioritizing interventions in specific urban areas and identifying the optimal periods for their implementation. Our framework is publicly available: \url{https://github.com/MLSM-at-DTU/floods_transport_rl}.	0	Morten W. Petersen;Arthur Vandervoort;Martin Drews;Karyn Morrissey;Francisco C. Pereira
22	arxiv	Impact of anthropogenic climate change on the East Asian summer monsoon	Claire Burke	2017-04-03T13:12:26Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00563v1	Impact of anthropogenic climate change on the East Asian summer monsoon The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is important for bringing rainfall to large areas of China. Historically, variations in the EASM have had major impacts including flooding and drought. We present an analysis of the impact of anthropogenic climate change on EASM rainfall in Eastern China using a newly updated attribution system. Our results suggest that anthropogenic climate change has led to an overall decrease in total monsoon rainfall over the past 65 years, and an increased number of dry days. However the model also predicts that anthropogenic forcings have caused the most extreme heavy rainfall events to become shorter in duration and more intense. With the potential for future changes in aerosol and greenhouse gas emissions, historical trends in monsoon rainfall may not be indicative of future changes, although extreme rainfall is projected to increase over East Asia with continued warming in the region.	0	Peter Stott
23	arxiv	ClimaText: A Dataset for Climate Change Topic Detection	Francesco S. Varini	2020-12-01T13:42:37Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00483v2	ClimaText: A Dataset for Climate Change Topic Detection Climate change communication in the mass media and other textual sources may affect and shape public perception. Extracting climate change information from these sources is an important task, e.g., for filtering content and e-discovery, sentiment analysis, automatic summarization, question-answering, and fact-checking. However, automating this process is a challenge, as climate change is a complex, fast-moving, and often ambiguous topic with scarce resources for popular text-based AI tasks. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{ClimaText}, a dataset for sentence-based climate change topic detection, which we make publicly available. We explore different approaches to identify the climate change topic in various text sources. We find that popular keyword-based models are not adequate for such a complex and evolving task. Context-based algorithms like BERT \cite{devlin2018bert} can detect, in addition to many trivial cases, a variety of complex and implicit topic patterns. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals a great potential for improvement in several directions, such as, e.g., capturing the discussion on indirect effects of climate change. Hence, we hope this work can serve as a good starting point for further research on this topic.	0	Jordan Boyd-Graber;Massimiliano Ciaramita;Markus Leippold
24	arxiv	The Human Effect Requires Affect: Addressing Social-Psychological Factors of Climate Change with Machine Learning	Kyle Tilbury	2020-11-24T23:34:54Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2011.12443v1	The Human Effect Requires Affect: Addressing Social-Psychological Factors of Climate Change with Machine Learning Machine learning has the potential to aid in mitigating the human effects of climate change. Previous applications of machine learning to tackle the human effects in climate change include approaches like informing individuals of their carbon footprint and strategies to reduce it. For these methods to be the most effective they must consider relevant social-psychological factors for each individual. Of social-psychological factors at play in climate change, affect has been previously identified as a key element in perceptions and willingness to engage in mitigative behaviours. In this work, we propose an investigation into how affect could be incorporated to enhance machine learning based interventions for climate change. We propose using affective agent-based modelling for climate change as well as the use of a simulated climate change social dilemma to explore the potential benefits of affective machine learning interventions. Behavioural and informational interventions can be a powerful tool in helping humans adopt mitigative behaviours. We expect that utilizing affective ML can make interventions an even more powerful tool and help mitigative behaviours become widely adopted.	0	Jesse Hoey
25	arxiv	Zonally opposing shifts of the intertropical convergence zone in response to climate change	Antonios Mamalakis	2020-07-01T04:48:26Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.00239v1	Zonally opposing shifts of the intertropical convergence zone in response to climate change Future changes in the location of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) due to climate change are of high interest since they could substantially alter precipitation patterns in the tropics and subtropics. Although models predict a future narrowing of the ITCZ during the 21st century in response to climate warming, uncertainties remain large regarding its future position, with most past work focusing on the zonal-mean ITCZ shifts. Here we use projections from 27 state-of-the-art climate models (CMIP6) to investigate future changes in ITCZ location as a function of longitude and season, in response to climate warming. We document a robust zonally opposing response of the ITCZ, with a northward shift over eastern Africa and the Indian Ocean, and a southward shift in the eastern Pacific and Atlantic Ocean by 2100, for the SSP3-7.0 scenario. Using a two-dimensional energetics framework, we find that the revealed ITCZ response is consistent with future changes in the divergent atmospheric energy transport over the tropics, and sector-mean shifts of the energy flux equator (EFE). The changes in the EFE appear to be the result of zonally opposing imbalances in the hemispheric atmospheric heating over the two sectors, consisting of increases in atmospheric heating over Eurasia and cooling over the Southern Ocean, which contrast with atmospheric cooling over the North Atlantic Ocean due to a model-projected weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation.	0	James T.

Nevertheless, their ability to generalize to climate change conditions remains questionable, mainly due to the stationarity assumption. We propose deep ensembles as a simple method to improve the uncertainty quantification of statistical downscaling models. By better capturing uncertainty, statistical downscaling models allow for superior planning against extreme weather events, a source of various negative social and economic impacts. Since no observational future data exists, we rely on a pseudo reality experiment to assess the suitability of deep ensembles for quantifying the uncertainty of climate change projections. Deep ensembles allow for a better risk assessment, highly demanded by sectoral applications to tackle climate change.	0	Jorge Baño-Medina

Climate-related hazards are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change. Statistical analyses clearly demonstrate a rise in the number of incidents (power failures) and their consequences in recent years. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to understand and quantify the resilience of the infrastructure to external stressors, which is essential for developing efficient climate change adaptation strategies. To accomplish this, robust fragility and other vulnerability models are necessary. These models are employed to assess the level of asset damage and to quantify losses for given hazard intensity measures. In this context, a comprehensive literature review is carried out to shed light on existing fragility models specific to the transmission network, distribution network, and substations. The review is organized into three main sections: damage assessment, fragility curves, and recommendations for climate change adaptation. The first section provides a comprehensive review of past incidents, their causes, and failure modes. The second section reviews analytical and empirical fragility models, emphasizing the need for further research on compound and non-compound hazards, especially windstorms, floods, lightning, and wildfires. Finally, the third section examines risk mitigation and adaptation strategies in the context of climate change. This review aims to improve the understanding of approaches to enhance the resilience of power grid assets in the face of climate change. These insights are valuable to various stakeholders, including risk analysts and policymakers, who are involved in risk modeling and developing adaptation strategies.	0	Mathaios Panteli;Sotirios Argyroudis

One approach for finding potential climate change indicators is to train a model that predicts the year from annual means of global temperatures and precipitations. Such data is available from the CMIP6 ensemble of simulations. Here a two-hidden-layer neural network trained on this data successfully predicts the year. Differences among temperature and precipitation patterns for which the model predicts specific years reveal changes through time. To find these optimal patterns, a new way of interpreting what the neural network has learned is explored. Alopex, a stochastic correlative learning algorithm, is used to find optimal temperature and precipitation maps that best predict a given year. These maps are compared over multiple years to show how temperature and precipitations patterns indicative of each year change over time.	0	Jason Stock

A strong driver of climate change and the subsequent environmental impact are greenhouse gases such as methane. However, the exact relation climate change has to the environmental condition cannot be easily established. Remote sensing methods are increasingly being used to quantify and draw connections between rapidly changing climatic conditions and environmental impact. A crucial part of this analysis is processing spectroscopy data using radiative transfer models (RTMs) which is a computationally expensive process and limits their use with high volume imaging spectrometers. This work presents an algorithm that can efficiently emulate RTMs using neural networks leading to a multifold speedup in processing time, and yielding multiple downstream benefits.	0	Brian D.

H. van Hateren	2011-11-22T12:36:37Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.5177v3	A fractal climate response function can simulate global average temperature trends of the modern era and the past millennium A climate response function is introduced that consists of six exponential (low-pass) filters with weights depending as a power law on their e-folding times. The response of this two-parameter function to the combined forcings of solar irradiance, greenhouse gases, and SO2-related aerosols is fitted simultaneously to reconstructed temperatures of the past millennium, the response to solar cycles, the response to the 1991 Pinatubo volcanic eruption, and the modern 1850-2010 temperature trend. Assuming strong long-term modulation of solar irradiance, the quite adequate fit produces a climate response function with a millennium-scale response to doubled CO2 concentration of 2.0 +- 0.3 K (mean +- standard error), of which about 50% is realized with e-folding times of 0.5 and 2 years, about 30% with e-folding times of 8 and 32 years, and about 20% with e-folding times of 128 and 512 years. The transient climate response (response after 70 years of 1% yearly rise of CO2 concentration) is 1.5 +- 0.2 K. The temperature rise from 1820-1950 can be attributed for about 70% to increased solar irradiance, while the temperature changes after 1950 are almost completely produced by the interplay of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols. The SO2-related forcing produces a small temperature drop in the years 1950-1970 and an inflection of the temperature curve around the year 2000. Fitting with a tenfold smaller modulation of solar irradiance produces a less adequate fit with millennium-scale and transient climate responses of 2.5 +- 0.4 K and 1.9 +- 0.3 K, respectively.	0

However, the physical processes underlying these changes are not well understood, in part due to the difficulty of characterizing and tracking changes in ocean physics in complex models. Using the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as a case study, we extend the method Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR) to a mesoscale eddy permitting climate model and identify regions of the ocean characterized by similar physics, called dynamical regimes, using readily accessible fields from climate models. To this end, we cluster grid cells into dynamical regimes and train an ensemble of neural networks, allowing uncertainty quantification, to predict these regimes and track them under climate change. Finally, we leverage this new knowledge to elucidate the dynamical drivers of the identified regime shifts as noted by the neural network using the 'explainability' methods SHAP and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation. A region undergoing a profound shift is where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current intersects the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge, an area important for carbon draw-down and fisheries. In this region, THOR specifically reveals a shift in dynamical regime under climate change driven by changes in wind stress and interactions with bathymetry. Using this knowledge to guide further exploration, we find that as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current shifts north under intensifying wind stress, the dominant dynamical role of bathymetry weakens and the flow intensifies.	0	Maike Sonnewald;Mariana C.

Hamwey	2005-12-19T19:08:21Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0512170v1	Active Amplification of the Terrestrial Albedo to Mitigate Climate Change: An Exploratory Study This study explores the potential to enhance the reflectance of solar insolation by the human settlement and grassland components of the Earth's terrestrial surface as a climate change mitigation measure. Preliminary estimates derived using a static radiative transfer model indicate that such efforts could amplify the planetary albedo enough to offset the current global annual average level of radiative forcing caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gases by as much as 30 percent or 0.76 W/m2. Terrestrial albedo amplification may thus extend, by about 25 years, the time available to advance the development and use of low-emission energy conversion technologies which ultimately remain essential to mitigate long-term climate change. However, additional study is needed to confirm the estimates reported here and to assess the economic and environmental impacts of active land-surface albedo amplification as a climate change mitigation measure.	0

In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of a conditional generative model that illustrates the consequences of climate change-induced flooding to encourage public interest and awareness on the issue. Because metrics for comparing the realism of different modes in a conditional generative model do not exist, we propose several automated and human-based methods for evaluation. To do this, we adapt several existing metrics, and assess the automated metrics against gold standard human evaluation. We find that using Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) with embeddings from an intermediary Inception-V3 layer that precedes the auxiliary classifier produces results most correlated with human realism. While insufficient alone to establish a human-correlated automatic evaluation metric, we believe this work begins to bridge the gap between human and automated generative evaluation procedures.	0	Alexandra Luccioni;Gautier Cosne;Michael S.

By providing a dataset for the research community, we aim to facilitate and encourage work on improving algorithms for retrieving evidential support for climate-specific claims, addressing the underlying language understanding challenges, and ultimately help alleviate the impact of misinformation on climate change. We adapt the methodology of FEVER [1], the largest dataset of artificially designed claims, to real-life claims collected from the Internet. While during this process, we could rely on the expertise of renowned climate scientists, it turned out to be no easy task. We discuss the surprising, subtle complexity of modeling real-world climate-related claims within the \textsc{fever} framework, which we believe provides a valuable challenge for general natural language understanding.

We achieve this by training a convolutional neural network on three years of SEVIRI and DARDAR data sets.

Brockway	2019-12-05T23:31:17Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02920v1	Weathering Adaptation: Grid Infrastructure Planning in a Changing Climate Decisions related to electric power systems planning and operations rely on assumptions and insights informed by historic weather data and records of past performance. Evolving climate trends are, however, changing the energy use patterns and operating conditions of grid assets, thus altering the nature and severity of risks the system faces. Because grid assets remain in operation for decades, planning for evolving risks will require incorporating climate projections into grid infrastructure planning processes. The current work traces a pathway for climate-aware decision-making in the electricity sector. We evaluate the suitability of using existing climate models and data for electricity planning and discuss their limitations. We review the interactions between grid infrastructure and climate by synthesizing what is known about how changing environmental operating conditions would impact infrastructure utilization, constraints, and performance. We contextualize our findings by presenting a case study of California, examining if and where climate data can be integrated into infrastructure planning processes. The core contribution of the work is a series of nine recommendations detailing advancements in climate projections, grid modeling architecture, and disaster preparedness that would be needed to ensure that infrastructure planning decisions are robust to uncertainty and risks associated with evolving climate conditions.	0	Laurel N.

However, global climate models typically simulate fire behavior at spatial scales too coarse for local risk assessments. Therefore, we propose a novel approach towards super-resolution (SR) enhancement of fire risk exposure maps that incorporates not only 2000 to 2020 monthly satellite observations of active fires but also local information on land cover and temperature. Inspired by SR architectures, we propose an efficient deep learning model trained for SR on fire risk exposure maps. We evaluate this model on resolution enhancement and find it outperforms standard image interpolation techniques at both 4x and 8x enhancement while having comparable performance at 2x enhancement. We then demonstrate the generalizability of this SR model over northern California and New South Wales, Australia. We conclude with a discussion and application of our proposed model to climate model simulations of fire risk in 2040 and 2100, illustrating the potential for SR enhancement of fire risk maps from the latest state-of-the-art climate models.	0	Gopal Erinjippurath

We train convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to encode two temperature field datasets from pre-industrial control runs in the CMIP5 first ensemble, obtained with the CCSM4 model and the IPSL-CM5A-LR model, respectively. With the later dataset, consisting of 36500 96$\times$96 surface temperature fields, the CAE out-performs PCA in terms of mean squared error of the reconstruction from a 40 dimensional encoding. Moreover, the noise in the filters of the convolutional layers in the autoencoders suggests that the CAE can be trained to produce better results. Our results indicate that convolutional autoencoders may provide an effective platform for the construction of surrogate climate models.	0	N. Lubbers;N. M. Urban

The latter is related to a long millennial solar oscillation and to changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere (e.g. aerosol and greenhouse gases). However, current general circulation climate models, e.g. the CMIP5 GCMs, to be used in the AR5 IPCC Report in 2013, fail to reconstruct the observed climatic oscillations. As an alternate, an empirical model is proposed that uses: (1) a specific set of decadal, multidecadal, secular and millennial astronomic harmonics to simulate the observed climatic oscillations; (2) a 0.45 attenuation of the GCM ensemble mean simulations to model the anthropogenic and volcano forcing effects. The proposed empirical model outperforms the GCMs by better hind-casting the observed 1850-2012 climatic patterns. It is found that: (1) about 50-60% of the warming observed since 1850 and since 1970 was induced by natural oscillations likely resulting from harmonic astronomical forcings that are not yet included in the GCMs; (2) a 2000-2040 approximately steady projected temperature; (3) a 2000-2100 projected warming ranging between 0.3 $^{o}C$ and 1.6 $^{o}C$, which is significantly lower than the IPCC GCM ensemble mean projected warming of 1.1 $^{o}C$ to 4.1 $^{o}C$; ; (4) an equilibrium climate sensitivity to $CO_{2}$ doubling centered in 1.35 $^{o}C$ and varying between 0.9 $^{o}C$ and 2.0 $^{o}C$.	0

In the public discourse, climate impacts are often discussed in the context of extreme weather events. Here, we analyse 65 million Twitter posts and 240 thousand news media articles related to 18 major hurricanes from 2010 to 2022 to clarify how hurricanes impact the public discussion around climate change. First, we analyse news content and show that climate change is the most prominent non-hurricane specific topic discussed by the news media in relation to hurricanes. Second, we perform a comparative analysis between reliable and questionable news media outlets, finding that the language around climate change varies between news media providers. Finally, using geolocated data, we show that accounts in regions affected by hurricanes discuss climate change at a significantly higher rate than accounts in unaffected areas, with references to climate change increasing by, on average, 80% after impact, and up to 200% for the largest hurricanes. Our findings demonstrate how hurricanes have a key impact on the public awareness of climate change.	0	Max Falkenberg;Alessandro Galeazzi;Fabiana Zollo;Walter Quattrociocchi;Andrea Baronchelli

In this track, we discuss mainly two key areas for improvement, focusing on the geographical impacts and utility framework. In the aspects of geographical impacts, We explore five critical aspects: (1) the shift from local to global impact, (2) variability in climate change effects across regions, (3) heterogeneity in geographical location and political structures, and (4) collaborations between adjacent nations, (5) the importance of including historical and cultural factors influencing climate negotiations. Furthermore, we emphasize the need to refine the utility and rewards framework to reduce the homogeneity and the level of overestimating the climate mitigation by integrating the positive effects of saving rates into the reward function and heterogeneity among all regions. By addressing these limitations, we hope to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of climate change negotiation models, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to devise targeted and appropriate strategies to tackle climate change at both regional and global levels.	0	Yuren Pang;Yu Qin

Using this dataset, we show that recent LLMs can classify human expert confidence in climate-related statements, especially in a few-shot learning setting, but with limited (up to 47%) accuracy. Overall, models exhibit consistent and significant over-confidence on low and medium confidence statements.

By implementing a group-forming method and group updating strategy, we address the complexities and imbalances in multi-region climate negotiations. Intra-group negotiations ensure that all members contribute to mitigation efforts, while inter-group negotiations use the proposal-evaluation framework to set mitigation and savings rates.

Global climate temperatures have unmistakably risen and naturally occurring climate variability alone cannot account for this trend. Human activities are estimated to have caused about 1.0 degree C of global warming above the pre-industrial baseline and if left unchecked, will continue to drastically damage the Earth and its inhabitants. Globally, natural disasters and subsequent economic losses have become increasingly impactful because of climate change. Both wildlife ecosystems and human habitats have been negatively impacted, from rising sea levels to alarming frequency of severe weather events around the world. Attempts towards alleviating the effects of global warming have often been at odds and remain divided among a multitude of strategies, reducing the overall effectiveness of these efforts. It is evident that collaborative action is required for avoiding the most severe consequences of climate change. This paper evaluates the main strategies (industrial/energy, political, economic, agricultural, atmospheric, geological, coastal, and social) towards both mitigating and adapting to climate change. As well, it provides an optimal combination of seven solutions which can be implemented simultaneously, working in tandem to limit and otherwise accommodate the harmful effects of climate change.

An important application of climate models is to provide metrics of mean and extreme climate changes, particularly under these alternative future scenarios, as these quantities drive the impacts of climate on society and natural systems. Because of the need to explore a wide range of alternative scenarios and other sources of uncertainties in a computationally efficient manner, climate models can only take us so far, as they require significant computational resources, especially when attempting to characterize extreme events, which are rare and thus demand long and numerous simulations in order to accurately represent their changing statistics. Here we use deep learning in a proof of concept that lays the foundation for emulating global climate model output for different scenarios. We train two ""loosely conditioned"" Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that emulate daily precipitation output from a fully coupled Earth system model: one GAN modeling Fall-Winter behavior and the other Spring-Summer. Our GANs are trained to produce spatiotemporal samples: 32 days of precipitation over a 64x128 regular grid discretizing the globe. We evaluate the generator with a set of related performance metrics based upon KL divergence, and find the generated samples to be nearly as well matched to the test data as the validation data is to test. We also find the generated samples to accurately estimate the mean number of dry days and mean longest dry spell in the 32 day samples. Our trained GANs can rapidly generate numerous realizations at a vastly reduced computational expense, compared to large ensembles of climate models, which greatly aids in estimating the statistics of extreme events."	0	Christopher Drazic;Brian Hutchinson;Ben Kravitz;Claudia Tebaldi

It is articulated around a discrete-time dynamic model of corn farm income with an annual time-step, corresponding to one agricultural cycle from planting to harvest. At each period, we compute the income given the corn yield, which is highly dependent on weather variables. We also provide a reproducible forecast of the yearly distribution of corn yield for 10 cities in Ontario. The price of corn futures at harvest time is taken into account and we fit our model by using 49 years of historical data.

However, it is computationally expensive to resolve complex climate processes at high spatial resolution. As one way to speed up climate simulations, neural networks have been used to downscale climate variables from fast-running low-resolution simulations, but high-resolution training data are often unobtainable or scarce, greatly limiting accuracy. In this work, we propose a downscaling method based on the Fourier neural operator. It trains with data of a small upsampling factor and then can zero-shot downscale its input to arbitrary unseen high resolution. Evaluated both on ERA5 climate model data and on the Navier-Stokes equation solution data, our downscaling model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art convolutional and generative adversarial downscaling models, both in standard single-resolution downscaling and in zero-shot generalization to higher upsampling factors. Furthermore, we show that our method also outperforms state-of-the-art data-driven partial differential equation solvers on Navier-Stokes equations. Overall, our work bridges the gap between simulation of a physical process and interpolation of low-resolution output, showing that it is possible to combine both approaches and significantly improve upon each other.	0	Alex Hernandez-Garcia;Paula Harder;Venkatesh Ramesh;Prasanna Sattegeri;Daniela Szwarcman;Campbell D.

ClimateQ&A is a conversational agent that uses LLMs to respond to queries based on over 14,000 pages of scientific literature from the IPCC and IPBES reports. Launched online in March 2023, the tool has gathered over 30,000 questions, mainly from a French audience. Its chatbot interface allows for the free formulation of questions related to nature*. While its main goal is to make nature science more accessible, it also allows for the collection and analysis of questions and their themes. Unlike traditional surveys involving closed questions, this novel method offers a fresh perspective on individual interrogations about nature. Running NLP clustering algorithms on a sample of 3,425 questions, we find that a significant 25.8% inquire about how climate change and biodiversity loss will affect them personally (e.g., where they live or vacation, their consumption habits) and the specific impacts of their actions on nature (e.g., transportation or food choices). This suggests that traditional methods of surveying may not identify all existing knowledge gaps, and that relying solely on IPCC and IPBES reports may not address all individual inquiries about climate and biodiversity, potentially affecting public understanding and action on these issues. *we use 'nature' as an umbrella term for 'climate change' and 'biodiversity loss'	0	Théo Alves Da Costa;Annabelle Blangero;Nicolas Chesneau

These models are far too computationally intensive to run repeatedly, but limited sets of runs are insufficient for some important applications, like adequately sampling distribution tails to characterize extreme events. As a compromise, emulators are substantially less expensive but may not have all of the complexity of an ESM. Here we demonstrate the use of a conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) to act as an ESM emulator. In doing so, we gain the ability to produce daily weather data that is consistent with what ESM might output over any chosen scenario. In particular, the GAN is aimed at representing a joint probability distribution over space, time, and climate variables, enabling the study of correlated extreme events, such as floods, droughts, or heatwaves.	0	Robert Link;Brian Hutchinson;Ben Kravitz;Abigail Snyder

The documents are long and tedious for manual analysis, especially for policy experts, lawmakers, and citizens who lack access or domain expertise to utilize data analytics tools. Potential consequences of such a situation include reduced citizen governance and involvement in climate policies and an overall surge in analytics costs, rendering less accessibility for the public. In this work, we use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based pipeline for the automatic summarization and analysis of 10-years of national energy and climate plans (NECPs) for the period from 2021 to 2030, established by 27 Member States of the European Union. We focus on analyzing policy framing, the language used to describe specific issues, to detect essential nuances in the way governments frame their climate policies and achieve climate goals. The methods leverage topic modeling and clustering for the comparative analysis of policy documents across different countries. It allows for easier integration in potential user-friendly applications for the development of theories and processes of climate policy.

Mobility plays a critical role in maintaining wellbeing, yet the increasing frequency and intensity of both nuisance and high-impact floods due to climate change are expected to significantly disrupt access to activities and destinations, thereby affecting overall wellbeing. Addressing climate adaptation presents a complex challenge for policymakers, who must select and implement policies from a broad set of options with varying effects while managing resource constraints and uncertain climate projections. In this work, we propose a multi-modular framework that uses reinforcement learning as a decision-support tool for climate adaptation in Copenhagen, Denmark. Our framework integrates four interconnected components: long-term rainfall projections, flood modeling, transport accessibility, and wellbeing modeling. This approach enables decision-makers to identify spatial and temporal policy interventions that help sustain or enhance subjective wellbeing over time. By modeling climate adaptation as an open-ended system, our framework provides a structured framework for exploring and evaluating adaptation policy pathways. In doing so, it supports policymakers to make informed decisions that maximize wellbeing in the long run.	0	Miguel Costa;Morten W. Petersen;Martin Drews;Sonja Haustein;Karyn Morrissey;Francisco C.

Such a hybrid model has better generalizability and interpretability together with a well-calibrated uncertainty associated with its prediction, rendering it more valuable and relevant to safety-critical applications under realistic usage scenarios.	0	Yu Zhang;Edwin Khoo

Traditional parameterizations that crudely but efficiently approximate these processes are a leading source of uncertainty in long-term projected warming and precipitation patterns. Machine Learning (ML)-based parameterizations have long been hailed as a promising alternative with the potential to yield higher accuracy at a fraction of the cost of more explicit simulations. However, these ML variants are often unpredictably unstable and inaccurate in \textit{coupled} testing (i.e. in a downstream hybrid simulation task where they are dynamically interacting with the large-scale climate model). These issues are exacerbated in out-of-distribution climates. Certain design decisions such as ``climate-invariant"" feature transformation for moisture inputs, input vector expansion, and temporal history incorporation have been shown to improve coupled performance, but they may be insufficient for coupled out-of-distribution generalization. If feature selection and transformations can inoculate hybrid physics-ML climate models from non-physical, out-of-distribution extrapolation in a changing climate, there is far greater potential in extrapolating from observational data. Otherwise, training on multiple simulated climates becomes an inevitable necessity. While our results show generalization benefits from these design decisions, the obtained improvment does not sufficiently preclude the necessity of using multi-climate simulated training data."	0	Mohamed Aziz Bhouri;Tom Beucler;Sungduk Yu;Michael Pritchard
57	arxiv	A Bayesian panel VAR model to analyze the impact of climate change on high-income economies	Florian Huber	2018-04-04T18:23:10Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.01554v3	A Bayesian panel VAR model to analyze the impact of climate change on high-income economies In this paper, we assess the impact of climate shocks on futures markets for agricultural commodities and a set of macroeconomic quantities for multiple high-income economies. To capture relations among countries, markets, and climate shocks, this paper proposes parsimonious methods to estimate high-dimensional panel VARs. We assume that coefficients associated with domestic lagged endogenous variables arise from a Gaussian mixture model while further parsimony is achieved using suitable global-local shrinkage priors on several regions of the parameter space. Our results point towards pronounced global reactions of key macroeconomic quantities to climate shocks. Moreover, the empirical findings highlight substantial linkages between regionally located climate shifts and global commodity markets.	0	Tamás Krisztin;Michael Pfarrhofer

Chen	2022-01-24T16:55:56Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10523v1	Interpretability in Convolutional Neural Networks for Building Damage Classification in Satellite Imagery Natural disasters ravage the world's cities, valleys, and shores on a regular basis. Deploying precise and efficient computational mechanisms for assessing infrastructure damage is essential to channel resources and minimize the loss of life. Using a dataset that includes labeled pre- and post- disaster satellite imagery, we take a machine learning-based remote sensing approach and train multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to assess building damage on a per-building basis. We present a novel methodology of interpretable deep learning that seeks to explicitly investigate the most useful modalities of information in the training data to create an accurate classification model. We also investigate which loss functions best optimize these models. Our findings include that ordinal-cross entropy loss is the most optimal criterion for optimization to use and that including the type of disaster that caused the damage in combination with pre- and post-disaster training data most accurately predicts the level of damage caused. Further, we make progress in the qualitative representation of which parts of the images that the model is using to predict damage levels, through gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). Our research seeks to computationally contribute to aiding in this ongoing and growing humanitarian crisis, heightened by anthropogenic climate change.	0	
59	arxiv	On the use of Deep Generative Models for Perfect Prognosis Climate Downscaling	Jose González-Abad	2023-04-27T18:35:18Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.00974v1	On the use of Deep Generative Models for Perfect Prognosis Climate Downscaling Deep Learning has recently emerged as a perfect prognosis downscaling technique to compute high-resolution fields from large-scale coarse atmospheric data. Despite their promising results to reproduce the observed local variability, they are based on the estimation of independent distributions at each location, which leads to deficient spatial structures, especially when downscaling precipitation. This study proposes the use of generative models to improve the spatial consistency of the high-resolution fields, very demanded by some sectoral applications (e.g., hydrology) to tackle climate change.	0	Jorge Baño-Medina;Ignacio Heredia Cachá
60	arxiv	Detangling the role of climate in vegetation productivity with an explainable convolutional neural network	Ricardo Barros Lourenço	2023-10-28T13:04:30Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18703v1	Detangling the role of climate in vegetation productivity with an explainable convolutional neural network Forests of the Earth are a vital carbon sink while providing an essential habitat for biodiversity. Vegetation productivity (VP) is a critical indicator of carbon uptake in the atmosphere. The leaf area index is a crucial vegetation index used in VP estimation. This work proposes to predict the leaf area index (LAI) using climate variables to better understand future productivity dynamics; our approach leverages the capacities of the V-Net architecture for spatiotemporal LAI prediction. Preliminary results are well-aligned with established quality standards of LAI products estimated from Earth observation data. We hope that this work serves as a robust foundation for subsequent research endeavours, particularly for the incorporation of prediction attribution methodologies, which hold promise for elucidating the underlying climate change drivers of global vegetation productivity.	0	Michael J.

61	arxiv	Toward an Effective Pedagogy of Climate Change: Lessons From a Physics Classroom	Vandana Singh	2020-08-01T15:19:26Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00281v2	Toward an Effective Pedagogy of Climate Change: Lessons From a Physics Classroom A major roadblock to effective climate education is the lack of radical visions (Kwauk, 2020) for engaging with climate change and related social-environmental crises in the classroom. Key aspects of the climate system: its inherent complexity and transdisciplinarity, the entanglement of social and natural systems, and the fact that it spans large scales of space and time - all present serious challenges to our modern, compartmentalized formal education systems. I present an argument for a justice-centered, inter-to-transdisciplinary conceptualization of climate change at the nexus of science, society and justice, which is designed to engage with the very features of the climate system that make it challenging. Based on pedagogical experiments in an undergraduate physics classroom for non-science majors, I identify five general barriers to teaching climate change, and formulate four dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy: the scientific-technological, the transdisciplinary, the onto-epistemological, and the psychosocial action dimensions. Within the context of a collaborative classroom culture informed by transformational learning, I describe the use of a meta-conceptual framework that, along with the issue of climate justice, seeks to realize all four dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy. This broad holistic framework is potentially adaptable to contexts and disciplines beyond undergraduate physics.	0

Akande	2025-12-01T23:06:04Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02260v1	EcoCast: A Spatio-Temporal Model for Continual Biodiversity and Climate Risk Forecasting Increasing climate change and habitat loss are driving unprecedented shifts in species distributions. Conservation professionals urgently need timely, high-resolution predictions of biodiversity risks, especially in ecologically diverse regions like Africa. We propose EcoCast, a spatio-temporal model designed for continual biodiversity and climate risk forecasting. Utilizing multisource satellite imagery, climate data, and citizen science occurrence records, EcoCast predicts near-term (monthly to seasonal) shifts in species distributions through sequence-based transformers that model spatio-temporal environmental dependencies. The architecture is designed with support for continual learning to enable future operational deployment with new data streams. Our pilot study in Africa shows promising improvements in forecasting distributions of selected bird species compared to a Random Forest baseline, highlighting EcoCast's potential to inform targeted conservation policies. By demonstrating an end-to-end pipeline from multi-modal data ingestion to operational forecasting, EcoCast bridges the gap between cutting-edge machine learning and biodiversity management, ultimately guiding data-driven strategies for climate resilience and ecosystem conservation throughout Africa.	0	Abdulrauf A.

63	arxiv	Response of Vertical Velocities in Extratropical Precipitation Extremes to Climate Change	Ziwei Li	2019-10-12T21:11:36Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05644v2	Response of Vertical Velocities in Extratropical Precipitation Extremes to Climate Change Precipitation extremes intensify in most regions in climate-model projections. Changes in vertical velocities contribute to the changes in intensity of precipitation extremes but remain poorly understood. Here, we find that mid-tropospheric vertical velocities in extratropical precipitation extremes strengthen overall in simulations of 21st-century climate change. For each extreme event, we solve the quasi-geostrophic omega equation to decompose this strengthening into different physical contributions. We first consider a dry decomposition in which latent heating is treated as an external forcing of upward motion. Much of the positive contribution to upward motion from increased latent heating is offset by negative contributions from increases in dry static stability and changes in the horizontal length scale of vertical velocities. However, taking changes in latent heating as given is a limitation when the aim is to understand changes in precipitation, since latent heating and precipitation are closely linked. Therefore, we also perform a moist decomposition of the changes in vertical velocities in which latent heating is represented through a moist static stability. In the moist decomposition, changes in moist static stability play a key role and contributions from other factors such as changes in the depth of the upward motion increase in importance. While both dry and moist decompositions are self-consistent, the moist dynamical perspective has greater potential to give insights into the causes of the dynamical contributions to changes in precipitation extremes in different regions.	0	Paul O'Gorman
64	arxiv	Improving the predictions of ML-corrected climate models with novelty detection	Clayton Sanford	2022-11-23T23:55:30Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13354v1	Improving the predictions of ML-corrected climate models with novelty detection While previous works have shown that machine learning (ML) can improve the prediction accuracy of coarse-grid climate models, these ML-augmented methods are more vulnerable to irregular inputs than the traditional physics-based models they rely on. Because ML-predicted corrections feed back into the climate model's base physics, the ML-corrected model regularly produces out of sample data, which can cause model instability and frequent crashes. This work shows that adding semi-supervised novelty detection to identify out-of-sample data and disable the ML-correction accordingly stabilizes simulations and sharply improves the quality of predictions. We design an augmented climate model with a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM) novelty detector that provides better temperature and precipitation forecasts in a year-long simulation than either a baseline (no-ML) or a standard ML-corrected run. By improving the accuracy of coarse-grid climate models, this work helps make accurate climate models accessible to researchers without massive computational resources.	0	Anna Kwa;Oliver Watt-Meyer;Spencer Clark;Noah Brenowitz;Jeremy McGibbon;Christopher Bretherton
65	arxiv	Influence of external forcings on abrupt millennial-scale climate changes: a statistical modelling study	Takahito Mitsui	2015-10-21T15:10:18Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06290v2	Influence of external forcings on abrupt millennial-scale climate changes: a statistical modelling study The last glacial period was punctuated by a series of abrupt climate shifts, the so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) events. The frequency of DO events varied in time, supposedly because of changes in background climate conditions. Here, the influence of external forcings on DO events is investigated with statistical modelling. We assume two types of simple stochastic dynamical systems models (double-well potential-type and oscillator-type), forced by the northern hemisphere summer insolation change and/or the global ice volume change. The model parameters are estimated by using the maximum likelihood method with the NGRIP Ca$^{2+}$ record. The stochastic oscillator model with at least the ice volume forcing reproduces well the sample autocorrelation function of the record and the frequency changes of warming transitions in the last glacial period across MISs 2, 3, and 4. The model performance is improved with the additional insolation forcing. The BIC scores also suggest that the ice volume forcing is relatively more important than the insolation forcing, though the strength of evidence depends on the model assumption. Finally, we simulate the average number of warming transitions in the past four glacial periods, assuming the model can be extended beyond the last glacial, and compare the result with an Iberian margin sea-surface temperature (SST) record (Martrat et al., Science, vol. 317, p. 502, 2007). The simulation result supports the previous observation that abrupt millennial-scale climate changes in the penultimate glacial (MIS 6) are less frequent than in the last glacial (MISs 2-4). On the other hand, it suggests that the number of abrupt millennial-scale climate changes in older glacial periods (MISs 6, 8, and 10) might be larger than inferred from the SST record.	0	Michel Crucifix
66	arxiv	Spatial Uncertainty Quantification in Wildfire Forecasting for Climate-Resilient Emergency Planning	Aditya Chakravarty	2025-10-08T03:47:14Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09666v1	Spatial Uncertainty Quantification in Wildfire Forecasting for Climate-Resilient Emergency Planning Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to increasing fire risk under climate change.	0	
67	arxiv	Paleoclimate Implications for Human-Made Climate Change	James E. Hansen	2011-05-05T02:08:16Z	http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0968v3	Paleoclimate Implications for Human-Made Climate Change Paleoclimate data help us assess climate sensitivity and potential human-made climate effects. We conclude that Earth in the warmest interglacial periods of the past million years was less than 1°C warmer than in the Holocene. Polar warmth in these interglacials and in the Pliocene does not imply that a substantial cushion remains between today's climate and dangerous warming, but rather that Earth is poised to experience strong amplifying polar feedbacks in response to moderate global warming. Thus goals to limit human-made warming to 2°C are not sufficient - they are prescriptions for disaster. Ice sheet disintegration is nonlinear, spurred by amplifying feedbacks. We suggest that ice sheet mass loss, if warming continues unabated, will be characterized better by a doubling time for mass loss rate than by a linear trend. Satellite gravity data, though too brief to be conclusive, are consistent with a doubling time of 10 years or less, implying the possibility of multi-meter sea level rise this century. Observed accelerating ice sheet mass loss supports our conclusion that Earth's temperature now exceeds the mean Holocene value. Rapid reduction of fossil fuel emissions is required for humanity to succeed in preserving a planet resembling the one on which civilization developed.	0	Makiko Sato
